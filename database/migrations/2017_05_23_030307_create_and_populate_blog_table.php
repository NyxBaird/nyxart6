        $postText[36] = "Hey guys. Fair warning- this is a bit more of a personal post. It's been a crazy last few months though. Since October I've gone from working on pizzas to sandwiches to sales and finally to my dream job as a software developer. I've learned new languages and studied everything from robotics to quantum entanglement. Yet somehow, I don't feel satisfied. I can't seem to take a break. I can barely force myself to eat and I have to take sleep aids to sleep. In January I ended up in the emergency room for severe malnutrition and it's impossible to relax. I've tried lots of things- spending more time with my family and friends, playing games I used to love, and even forcing myself on a few dates. Throughout all of this though I always come back to two things- programming and music.<br>
	<br>
	Now, I know neither of those is inherently bad, but it's become an obssession. A couple months ago I thought I'd be stuck taking orders for life, but now that I've managed to pull through that I don't feel like I can stop. I've avoided appointments and turned down friends and family to code and compose. For every level I hit in a game my guilt drives me to hours more of studying and composing. I'm a work-a-holic. I can't seem to justify walking away from my unfinished projects though, and I never feel like I can say any of them are complete. I've been taking on literally every project I can get my hands on. While working as a sales professional at my last job I managed to pick up the task of Web Master, Search Engine Optimization specialist, and began my own personal sales dashboard to replace the companies current CRM.<br>
	<br>
	I've also put hundreds of hours into music, but none of it ever sounds good enough anymore. I have what should be a final draft of my vocal version of Shooting Star but I can never bring myself to release it. I've also composed hours of music that I just can't seem to justify finishing. I couldn't even leave my website be and as you've probably noticed, I've begun completely re-designing it.<br>
	<br>
	I don't honestly know why I'm typing this out other then I feel like I need to get some of this off of my back. There's just so much to do, and so much to learn. Is this a normal way to feel? Can anyone else relate?<br>

	Best Wishes,<br>

I only had Pierre for about a year, but we'd gone through a lot together including 4 moves and close to a thousand miles in between. I guess I already knew he was going to die soon (he was a really old parakeet) but it still hit me pretty hard when I found out and I'm not ashamed to admit that I did a fair amount of crying.

Just a heads up, this is going to more random and sporadic then my usual posts as I don't have any specific thing to write about but I feel like I need to write something.<br><br>I've been thinking a lot lately about what it means to live. Often I find myself questioning my own worth as an individual. I'm in huge amounts of debt and I still don't have a steady job and I often find myself wondering if it wouldn't just be easier and more fair to those around me if I just let go. I don't let go though because I believe that even in my current state, if I can just get back on my feet, I DO have potential. In fact, I believe everyone on earth has incredible potential if they're given a chance. It's just that unfortunately, most people never get the chance to be everything they can.<br><br><br><br>I met a man a couple months ago while I was working at a pine tree farm. The work was grueling, minimum wage work for a temporary labor company. You can't get much lower then that in the general work force. The mans name was Henry, and as we cut, moved, and sorted the miniature pine trees I started talking with him. Henry's goal in life (as he very enthusiastically told me) was to start a charity to help people in third world countries. He had been planning this for years and he had every little detail worked out. Henry is a man that I will never forget. It touched me deeply to see someone like him working for a temporary labor company doing minimum wage work and doing his best to survive and having such a noble dream. I promised myself that day and I'm writing it here to ensure that I will never forget; if I ever find my own path in life and gain a surplus of money, I WILL find Henry and I swear that I will help him make his dream happen. I can't imagine a better way to spend what money I'm able to make.<br><br>A few years ago I worked at a summer camp called Maple Dell. The first year I worked there I really loved it. I looked forward to leaving for camp each Sunday evening and when I returned home Saturday mornings it was only to wait anxiously to go back to camp. I loved working with the scouts and I loved the feeling I got when I knew I had made a difference in a young mans life. When camp ended that first year I simply couldn't wait for the next summer to roll around so that I could return to that beloved outdoor getaway. The next summer eventually came though, and when I returned to summer camp I found that it wasn't as wonderful as I had remembered it. The staff that year was especially big (70 people) and full of different cliques. The aquatics staff stayed with the aquatics staff, the nature staff stayed with the nature staff, and so on. Unfortunately I had chosen to work the archery range that year and though the rest of the shooting sports staff was friendly, the archery range was on the opposite side of camp and without the ability to communicate with the other staff on a consistent basis I quickly fell out of the group and starting doing everything on my own. It wasn't that I wanted to be alone, but I just didn't fit into any of the staff cliques. Summer quickly grew tedious and I felt very alone. I no longer waited eagerly to be driven to camp each Sunday, and instead I began to dread my camp experience. It was in my little archery shed though, high in the mountains and secluded from the rest of the world that I really began to think about life and what it meant to live. For hundreds of hours I sat alone and thought. Soon I found that my own thoughts just weren't enough. I wanted to know what other people thought it meant to live, so slowly I began asking people. I got many many answers, always long and thought through. It came to a point where the stories stopped being interesting and slowly became just words. Meaningless words. So I thought of three questions. Three questions that I believe to this day say more about a person then any amount of stories or words. I've recorded hundreds of answers to these questions since then, written down in a small notebook that I carried around with me and then eventually transfered to an online document. I considered making the document public, but I believe a persons answers to these questions are very personal and I wouldn't feel right sharing them with the world. I will tell you the questions though (if I haven't asked you already. I know a lot of you who will read this have already heard these).<br><br>Question One: Using only one word, describe what happiness means to you.<br>Question Two: Using only one word, describe what unhappiness means to you.<br>Question Three: Using only one word, describe what it means to live.<br><br>I'm always more then willing to share my answers- I've put years of thought into them. I would like to hear more answers though, so if I haven't asked you these questions already, you're more then welcome to send me an email at AdmiralCubie@yahoo.com with your answers. I'll add them to my list. These three questions are so very important to me though. I grew up in a place where good and evil were pre-defined and I was told at a very young age what would and would not make me happy in life. Though I understand and respect these things, I believe that good, evil, and happiness aren't things that one can be told. I believe you have to find those answers yourself. That's my goal in life, to eventually answer these questions for myself. This is why I believe those are the three most important questions that can ever be asked.<br><br>Anyway, I've rambled enough and I bet many of those who started reading this never got to the end. >.< If you did read this all though, then thank you. It means a lot to me to know people care about what I have to say. That's all for now though.<br>Always Sincerely,<br>-AdmiralCubie<br>~Nyx";

        $postText[16] = "<center><img src='resources/blog/2013/pork-and-beans.jpg' width='600'></center><br>So I had this really wacky lucid dream last night. It started out with me going back to Utah to visit my family, and while I was there I realized that I should grab a few personal items of mine to bring back to Calfornia with me. So I went to go grab my stuff from my secret hiding place.<br><br>Now, you know how sometimes you'll have three or four dreams with the same wacky thing in them? Well, that's the case with my secret hiding place. My secret hiding place is my dreamland dillusion that somehow there's a lever in my family's garage that I can pull that will open up a trapdoor on the wall that leads down a secret passage way into the ground. At the end of the secret passageway is cavern just beneath this old apple tree on our neightbors property where the roots have formed a sort of roof (I think I actually remember having a dream in the past where I had to dig out this mini-cavern).<br><br>Anyway, I'm trying to find the secret lever that opens the trapdoor to the tunnel when I suddenly remember that I'm supposed to be mowing the lawn and that my mom's going to get angry if I don't mow the lawn like I'm supposed to so I take the lawn mower and pull it just outside the garage and turn it on then leave it there hoping she'll think the sound means I'm mowing while I try and figure out what happened to the lever.<br><br>Now this is where it gets really wacky. I, for whatever reason, can't seem to locate the lever, so I just give up and go over to where I know the trapdoor is located to try and just pry it open somehow. You need to know that in my family's garage there are two workbenches on the side where the trapdoor is located and behind those we have a tendancy to keep like wood and old pipes and stuff. So I go ahead and move the workbenches (which are really heavy and much too cluttered to move easily in real life) and there's a big piece of plywood between me and the door. I move the plywood, and suddenly I'm buried in pork and beans on the garage floor. At that moment in time, my dad decides to come out to grab something from the garage so I quickly attempt to bury myself more completely in pork and beans so he won't realize that I made this giant mess. I'm unsuccesful and he sees me anyway and this is his response; he sighs really loudly and says 'good thing I was already planning on going to the store to buy more pork and beans today'.<br><br>Oh yeah- I should probably note that I had a video camera and the entire time I was trying to record me going down to the secret passage so that I could show people. Anyway though, the camera just disappeared after the whole pork and beans incident, so I guess it's not vital to the story. We did end up finding the lever and I grabbed my stuff.<br><br>Then Pierre landed on my face in real life and woke me up (this seems to be happening more and more frequently lately. I wonder if Pierre just likes the startled expression on my face when suddenly bird). I'm still pretty tired, which I guess is a side-effect of lucid dreaming, but when I woke up I knew I had to jot this down real quick for you guys. #Dedication #LucidDreaming #Hashtags";

        $postTitle[14] = "A Quick Story...";
        $postText[14] = "Just a quick story. I was walking from donating blood to the mall to sell Pokemon Diamond and Pokemon Pearl at Game Stop for some money to pay back a friend when I was stopped by a homeless man (not too much older then I, maybe ~25) and asked for either money or food. I was startled, having never been directly approached like this by such a person. I politely told the man that I had neither food nor money to give him (I really didn't). The man then asked if I had a phone he could borrow. He was on a bike, and though somewhat wary of him, I allowed him the use of my phone as long as he got off his bike and allowed me to watch it. He was understanding and agreed, so I promptly dialed the requested number and allowed him use of my android.<br><br>This man was in a difficult situation. His roommate had stolen his 200 for that months rent then gotten himself arrested, and this poor man had been locked out of his unpaid (his roommate stole his money, remember?) apartment. He didn't tell me this, but I overheard him explaining to a sympathetic friend via my cell phone.<br><br>When the man returned my phone I voiced a question that had been working its way into my mind. I told him that I was headed to the mall to sell a couple games for money, and that if he wished to tag along I'd use some of the money to purchase some food for him. The man gratefully accepted and so we made our way to the mall.<br><br>It turns out that Game Stop only pays cash for half of the in-store price of the used games you sell (basically $10 for a normally $30 game). This left me just barely enough to pay back my friend. I certainly didn't want to leave my poor homeless companion hungry though, so I went ahead and sold my copy of Pokemon Black as well. The man was very grateful for the food I bought him and after thanking me went on his way to meet the friend he had called earlier.<br><br>I left the mall one game and eight dollars short of what I had expected, but I still had enough to pay back my friend and felt quite good about what happened. At this point I had a lot on my mind, so I decided to take a new route home. Something new (if just a little out of my way). I ended up taking a stroll through a poorer part of town. Normally I would've passed through without seeing anything particularly noteworthy. I was more than a little thoughtful this time though, so when I passed the family weeding a beautiful garden in the middle of a garage-strewn field and the man mowing a weed-overgrown lawn in an attempt to make it look nice, I mentally applauded their efforts.<br><br>Kudos to everyone like the two men and the family I saw today. It reminds me just how determined people can be. It makes me incredibly happy to see people trying their very best to move forward in their lives, regardless their current situation.<br><br>This story doesn't really serve any purpose, nor does it have some big, underlying moral I'm trying to impress upon people. Rather, this story is everything I love about people. People are beautiful, and it's not their money or social standing that makes them so, it's their ability to be honest and hard workers and to not give up, no matter where their lives take them.<br><br>Thank you ever so much to the wonderful man I met today who allowed me the pleasure of buying him dinner.<br><br>~Nyx";

I cannot play a real piano anymore, but thanks to the incredible science of the Leap device, I'll be able to play the virtual piano I create, and I will not stop work on the project until I have created such a virtual piano. I guess I lied when I called my November performance my last ever performance. Expect more piano music, and expect it in a way that nobody's ever seen it played before.

        $postText[9] = "My life is by no means what one might consider ‘exciting’. Sometimes I’ll pretend it is- running across a busy street to make it look like I have something important to do, telling myself that something probably hangs by a thread and the only way for me to get there in time is to do irrationally stupid things. Of course- I guess this is true to a point, consider all the things we’ve missed in life simply by being there thirty seconds too late. I know that personally, I’ve missed plenty due to this unfortunate phenomenon. That last donut, held in reserve after an arduous meeting, only to be taken as seconds by someone else while I was too busy pretending I had a good reason for having my backpack with me.<br><br>Of course, sometimes, (when I start to feel shameful or get bored of placing myself in the imaginative, “I’m-super-mysterious-because-I-carry-my-backpack-around-everywhere-and-you-don’t-know-why” slot,) I find it fun to take a step back myself and wonder at the possibly clandestine missions of others. Perhaps the kid three rows up in a black shirt is actually a soviet spy, here to undermine the united states psychological state by existing with its volatile-minded teenagers in the hell-house commonly known as ‘high school’.<br><br>Now, this all might sound silly to you (though perhaps maybe you’ve found yourself in similar situations,) but there are just some things in life that overly-imaginative people like me just can’t ignore! Take for example, my backpack. Why do I wear it around everywhere? It’s certainly not because it’s comfortable, or because I can traffic illegal weapons and top secret information. In fact, the answer is much simpler than that. I carry my backpack around everywhere because it’s good to hold things in. Especially during winter when having to carry around a grocery bag after going shopping could mean frostbite in your fingers. Wearing my backpack around everywhere I go is simply a useful and convenient way for me to store and carry around things with me that I otherwise would have to leave elsewhere. I believe that in the case of an apocalypse, backpacks will be the new big thing. I mean- where better to store your anti-zombie warfare than in a bag that will always be close at hand?<br><br>Now, let’s examine the lives of other people. The usually innocent bystanders that people like me place in a shroud of mysterious potential. For instance, if that kid three rows up isn’t a clandestine soviet spy, then how come I have yet to hear him say anything? It could simply be because he is busy typing himself, that perhaps he’s just shy, or maybe that his frequent glances at me aren’t to try and implant psychic thoughts of Russian supremacy in my head- but rather a look to say, “stop frequently looking up at me, then back down at your computer screen to type. It’s making me nervous.” Or, maybe his reason for remaining silent is to hide his russian accent. Or because he can’t speak because he had his voice box removed at birth and that’s why he’s been such a valuable psychic to the soviet capital, because he’s had to speak psychically since birth and now he’s an expert at it.<br><br>Just food for thought.<br><br>-Cubie";

        $postText[8] = "<center><img src'resources/blog/2012/pianorose.jpg' width='600' height='auto'></center><br><br>This is it. The culmination of years of practice and composition coming together to this one event. <br><Br>Tonight, in about four hours, is my last piano performance ever. The reasons for this are because I don't really have anywhere else to perform except at my mother's bi-annual performance for beginning piano students. I'm not really one of her students, nor am I a beginning musician, but I consider myself lucky nonetheless to have a place to let out my musical talent. By the time her next 'recital' comes around I'll be busy trying to graduate, getting ready for college, and possibly have no use of my right wrist due to probable upcoming surgery to deal with my carpal tunnel (or 'musicians wrist' as I so 'fondly' call it).<br><br>Needless to say, I'm somewhat nervous. Dropping an instrument feels like losing an old friend, and a central part of my life. I really hope that after surgery I can even recover quickly enough to continue guitar, which doesn't require as much wrist movement. (Note that just because many guitarists move their strumming wrist a lot when playing, doesn't mean that the movement is actually necessary, and I'm not getting surgery in my left wrist after all. :P)<br><br>In memorial of the piano I've played for years, here's a timeline; complete with the music I played and my reason for playing, even though I've only had one place to play and no real support due to my lack of teaching (note that while my parents have encouraged my learning to play the piano, it was always more of 'courtesy encouragement' because they wanted to support my interests).<br><br><br><br>The beginning: <br>I distinctly remember asking my little sister (who was in piano lessons at the time) to point out 'Middle C' on both the piano and on the then-unreadable bass clef. My reason for asking was a song that a friend of mine emailed my way called 'I Am The Doctor'. It sounded fun, and really I wanted to learn the piano. At the time I had had a couple years of violin and was playing the trumpet. I never really went anywhere with my violin and the trumpet could only handle chords in a group. I wanted a solo instrument on which I could play anything I wanted too (it's for this reason that many of my songs are unrealistically fast and un-simplified for piano. I don't want chords and a single note melody- I started playing so that I could play compressed full scores of music). <br><br>My first piano song was an arrangement of 'I Am The Doctor', that was emailed to me by a friend. A big thanks to that friend for giving me a reason to start.<br><Br>When my mom allowed me to perform 'I Am The Doctor' at her performance, there was no going back for me. Now, I can be rather shy and self-conscious. My body still trembles when I perform solo, despite having performed music since I started violin at age four. So when I was complimented graciously by members of the audience after the performance, I was shocked. No one had ever come up specifically to me to congratulate me after a performance, and I knew I had to perform for them again when one family eagerly asked me a few months later if I was going to play another Doctor Who song for the upcoming recital. I agreed, surprised that I was being asked to return and play again. I sat down at my computer that day, and began writing the song for the next performance. An arrangement of music from Doctor Who, just as requested. This was how 'The Doctor's Legacy' came to be. You can listen to it here: <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nDWVc448oI'>The Doctor's Legacy</a><br><br>After that performance, there was no going back. I loved piano and the freedom it gave me. Not only did the music I played make me feel good, but I was no longer bound to the single notes of my trumpet. I had the ability to perform solo, any song I wished. My third song was performed at my mothers next piano recital. It was an arrangement of 'Winter Wrap Up'. I learned to play it on piano by ear, so there is no existing sheet music of the way I play it. You can find the complete score that I rebuilt here though: <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNfOdW112DI&feature=plcp'>Winter Wrap Up</a><br><br>Winter Wrap Up was performed at my mothers Winter Recital last year.<br><br>In June, I went to a religious summer camp called 'EFY' (especially for youth). I went and signed up for the variety show there. Yes, it was only a variety show, but I consider this the highlight of my piano performing career. There were 2000+ people in my 'session' (the people at EFY at the time). Of those 2000 people, 40 tried out specifically for piano. Of those 40, I was one in three chosen to perform at this performance. I was stunned. I hadn't expected to be chosen as a performer. Me, a self-taught pianist in the beginning of their second year of teaching themselves, was chosen to perform my piano rendition of 'Winter Wrap Up' in front of a crowd of 2000+ teenagers. I got a standing ovation from most of the audience. (I attribute the standing ovation mostly to the extremely positive atmosphere of the religious camp, but it was still the high point in my piano playing career.)<br><br>At the end of June, for my mothers summer/spring recital, I performed my arranged compilation of themes from Pokemon Emerald. Better known simply as 'Emerald'. You can find the music here: <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmMKSZ4fHgQ'>Emerald</a><br><br>Now it's November, time for my mothers winter recital. Unless I am extremely fortunate, this will be my last piano performance. I've been allowed to play two pieces of music. The first is a prelude that will be played to start off the recital, it is entitled 'Memories'. Memories will include select parts from all the piano pieces I've played at recitals in the past. The beginning of 'I Am The Doctor', the end of 'The Doctor's Legacy', 'Winter Wrap Up', and the end of 'Emerald'. I will be putting up a video of my live performance of 'Memories'.<br><Br>My second and main song for this years recital will be performed at the very end and will be entitled, 'Farewell'. It will feature parts from my arrangement of the Pokemon Diamond closing theme, entitled 'Diamond', my unreleased piano arrangement of 'Ns Farewell', and my own music to tie them together. I will be putting up a video of my live performance of 'Farewell'.<br><br>If you've read all the way to this point, then thank you.

It has the worlds weirdest people, smallest towns, and coldest winters.<br><br>...Alright, maybe Antarctica and Alaska have the coldest winters, but no one really lives there either! Plus, Utah's winters are certainly the craziest! Somewhere between the short span of July and December, our weather goes from a hundred degrees any given day and looking like this:<br><center><img src'resources/blog/2012/summer.jpg' width='600' height='auto'></center><br>To a bitter, harsh, cold, often-in-the-negatives environment much like this: <br><center><img src'resources/blog/2012/winter.jpeg' width='600' height='auto'></center><br>And, if you think about it, the picture's even more appropriate because there's snow everywhere and not a good place to sit down. :/<br><br><Br><br>In Utah, winters consist of three stages of cold.<br><br>1. October: Mornings are frosty, you can see your breath, and if it snowed it wouldn't rain but the snow would melt quickly, turning the world into a wet, dreary environment. Hands and toes are cold.<br><br>2. November - Mid-December: Mornings are frosty, but there are generally patches of snow on the ground as well, and there is frost on top of the frost that first appeared (yes, it's a thing). The air is dry because all the moisture is busy causing frost-ception. I leave my trumpet in my locker so my hands can switch back and forth between warming in my pocket to holding my guitar as I walk to school. My hands and toes are always cold and sometimes I find it difficult to play instruments because my cold fingers are so sluggish. The snow is not wet, but sometimes if the day gets warm enough it will melt a bit.<br><br>3. Mid-December - February: There is NO moisture in the air. My lungs burn if I try to run any distance because of the lack of moisture, the searing coldness, and the high altitude air (it's this time of year when I remember- 'Oh yeah! I live up in the rocky mountains!'). I leave my guitar and trumpet in my locker because my hands will fall off if I have to take them out of my pockets to carry my instruments to school. By the time I get to school in the mornings, (keep in mind the walk to my high school is only about a block), my lips and fingers are in pain and sometimes if I forget to dry my hair after my morning shower it will freeze solid and I can snap pieces off of it. At any given time, I have to warm my hands under hot water for a good ten minutes just to get to the point where I can play an instrument or type on my computer. Life is miserable. Snow is so cold that it feels dry and powdery like sugar in my hands, and parts of the roads turn into perma-frost speed bumps. People don't get speeding tickets anymore, they just crash.<br><br>Not that I hate Utah or anything, but as soon as I'm self-sufficient, I'm moving someplace warm. Maybe Pennsylvania. Is it warm there?<br><br>Sincerely Cold,<br>-AdmiralCubie";

Needless to say this was a problem.<br><br>Upon closer examination, it appeared that the reason behind much of the red text, were typos! For those of you who don't know, I have the unfortunate habit of looking at my hands and not the computer screen when I type. This is not due to a state of constant inaccuracy, but rather just an unhelpful habit I've picked up over years of using my computer keyboard as a MIDI input keyboard for musical reasons. Me not paying apt attention to the screen however, caused me to fail at recognizing typos, and continue on with the seemingly endless task of computer programming homework.<br><br><Br><br>Now, you might be asking, 'what is the reason for your current lack of motor impairment?

And so, this year, I decided to take my schools guitar course. About a week into the said course, I began noticing things. Firstly, that guitar was really, really fun. Secondly, that playing my steel-strung guitar really, really hurt. After intense self-debate, it was concluded that I needed to get rid of one of these two attributes of playing the guitar. Being the person that I am, and enjoying guitar as much as I have, I decided that the best solution for me, would be to practice until callouses developed on my fingers and playing the guitar stopped hurting. This was a good, sound idea. Unfortunately, my way of looking at good, sound ideas is hardly normal.<br><br>Practicepracticepracticepracticepracticeohmahgoshthisissoawesomeletmeplaythissongnext.<br><br>There's a sort of addiction to being able to play your favorite songs on an instrument, and when I figured out that by learning just a few finger positions, (chords) I could successfully play any given song to the point of definite recognition, I was hooked.

Even this post has been arduous in the writing, and piano is near impossible! Gotta say though, when my fingers stop being weird and stupid, this'll have been worth it.
